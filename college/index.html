<h1>Collegiate files for Beginners</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Here, I'll keep the majority of files with instructions for college</p>
<br>
<p>you can either download seperate files, or download the zip file with all of the items and contents</p>
<br>
<div style="border:thin solid #000;">
<p><a href="collegiate.zip" target="_blank">collegiate.zip</a> | this file holds all of the files in this list</p>
<p><a href="catalog2016-17.pdf" target="_blank">College Catalog</a> | Use this to find info on a college course here</p>
<p><a href="courseList.pdf" target="_blank">courseList</a> | holds the shortened list of college classes and some info</p>
<p><a href="creditRequirements.pdf" target="_blank">Credit Requirements</a> | The list of required credits for high school and college (!very important!)</p>
<p><a href="courseSchedule.pdf" target="_blank">My schedule</a> | this is my schedule that you can use as an example for your classes</p>
<p><a href="classAdvice.docx" target="_blank">Class Advice</a> | advice on classes from Nick Cottrell</p>
<p><a href="misc.pdf">Misc</a> | will contain mostly extra stuff. Not really important</p>

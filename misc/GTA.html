<h1>Modding GTA 5</h1>
<h3>For Pengaroo</h3>
</header>
<main>
<h4>Hello Pengaroo</h4>
<p>I heard that youve started gta recently, but currently youve been having a hard time keeping up with its economy (Everyone does. even those who're far in the game)</p>
<p>Ive been asked to give you the tools ive used to speed past many grinding parts of the game. Of course, even with these tools the game still requires a little grinding.</p>
<p>But with these tools comes some responsibility. You must be careful with these tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never use the tools around people you dont know or trust (no randomers, no anti-cheat people, no trolls, etc.)</li>
<li>Dont over use the tools at any moment, use them sparingly and wisely</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay within these rules and you should be fine. But that does mean that you need to be descreet with them so done use them to battle other players or anything. Failure to do so may not only get you banned, but make rockstar (r*) patch the mod and make it entirely unusable unless the mod maker makes an update.</p>

<hr />
<br />
<p>And now that were passed the warnings, we can now get onto the actual tools. These are the tools I use regularly and trust.</p>
<div id="links">

<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p>Now that you got the tools, you should be good to go. HOWEVER, i still have advice to give, and there is some knowldege on how to use those tools to their maximum use.</p>
<h4>SOLO SESSION</h4>
<p>For the majority of your gta career, becasue most random gta players are sadists, youre gonne be spending most of your time in a empty session grinding businesses for cash. The solo session tool is absolutely 100% safe because it doesnt interact with gta at all. You can accomplish the same thing via resource manager, but this is a simple way to constantly block anyone from entering your session, allowing you to do ceo missions and use hacks without anyone bothering you. The tool also offers a way to allow other friends to be on the session and block other people but not them. I havent figured how to get it working yet, but if you want to use it, its your option.</p>
<h4>The Triangle Safe Menu</h4>
<p>The Triangle menu is a regular mod menu is mostly safe because its an external tool and it isnt injecting anything into the game. It adds many features that I'd acknowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Semi-god</b> options dont make you immortal, but regen health so fast that it makes you hard to kill. Its incredibly useful for certain heists and missions so that you dont end up stuck (Though it wouldnt help in Pacific Standard since you still get damaged). I implore you not to use this in combat since that'll only encourage r* more to patch it and it would get you banned.</li>
<li>The <b>no wanted level</b>, and set 0 wanted level work as expected and are really useful for when you need to remove wanted level to continue missions and to stop police from constantly ramming you.</li>
<li><b>RP hacks</b> do work, but theyre slow and not as important</li>
<li>The <b>money hacks</b> for this menu NO NOT WORK. If you use them, youll get maybe ~36k then crash. if you want to get money, use the menu to do ceo/biker/heist easier or use the other tool.</li>
<li><b>The Teleport</b> option Id say is the most powerful and the best part of the mod menu. You can use f5 to instantly tp to the purple marker. It also comes with a menu of pre-programmed places that you can select and tp to. This is super powerful because the menu's settings are in xml. This means that you can add on and edit the menu. Ive used this to add tp location thanks to the menu's <em>current coords</em> command. With this I've added coord for all my warehouses and my businesses, my bunker, and everywhere important. This means that with using CEO vehicles as an example. I can get into my stolen high price car then press the tp button in the menu to go straight to my warehouse. tp there, tap forward, profit. all without the dodging the cars and shooters. quick and painless. This feature alone is a good reason to use this menu and the fact that it can get you legitimate money the easiest way possible. <b>WARNING:</b> GTA can get a bit antsy about you instantly going from 1 place to another, and itll try to tp you back as soon as you get there. To fix this, you just need to spam the tp button until you stay at the tp mark. HOWEVER, there can be issues, like sometimes you can end up only tp'ing half way or you end up tp'ing somewhere else entirely high in the air and end up crashing down (I've had it where i tried tping my ceo car to the warehouse and ended up high up in the air above the ocean), you can also end up at your destination under the ground. This is fine, just wait till you fall a little bit longer, soon enough youll end up back on the ground like normal.</li>
</ul>
<br /><hr />
<h4>Job Hopper</h4>
<p>This is the tool that's gonna make you all the money. This tool doesnt do anything crazy to you. What it does is you press F9 (You might wanna change that key in Job-Hopper.ini) and it gives you 100k, simple as that. However, the tool has a limit on how many times it can be activated in a certain span of time (and for good reason), but you can get around this if you want to get into want to get into some coding with any keyboard macro (I use AHK or AutoIt) and make a keyboard script that presses the designated key once every 1 minute 20 seconds (80 seconds). This can let you loop it and passively make cash without having to constantly remind youreself to press the key to get cash, and now you can do businesses while the macro makes you money over time. Again, be responsible with this one as well, or we may never see it again.</p><hr />
<br /><br />
<h3>That is all</h3>
<p>And that is all, I hope you do well, and maybe at some point ill see you around on the gta sessions with dado, but until then be safe and have fun!</p>

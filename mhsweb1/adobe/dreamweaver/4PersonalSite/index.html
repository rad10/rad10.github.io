<h3>Introduction to me</h3>
<p>This website was made by Nick Cottrell. It was made for Web Design PD01. Still don't have anything to write for here.
I got started in computers four years ago when i got my <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=strict&q=dell+inspiron+n5050+specs" target="_blank">first laptop</a>, and i played around with everything, until I started playing around with lua, then <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">HTML</a> (like shown here). 
I have my certifications in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">MOS</a> (Microsoft Office Specialist), which means I'm certified in most office products. I built my first Desktop computer last year. 
I manage, two laptops, a desktop, and a server. I Always love helping my friends. 
I'd help my computer class catch up with the assignment and help teach the students separatly when needed. 
I have Helped friends build towers(desktops) before, and I'd repair problems when my family submits a broken laptop.
